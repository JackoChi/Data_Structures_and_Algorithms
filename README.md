# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms

In this project, I complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. 

I use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. 

Lastly, I perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.
